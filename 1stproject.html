                    There is not a crime, there is not a dodge, there is not a trick, 
                    there is not a swindle, there is not a vice which does not live 
                    by secrecy.

                    stories remind you of your wounds.

                <p>Here's to the mountains God's,Who keep calling us back,By appeaing
                    in dreamy visuals of our mind, And letting us find.Tje joy of life in the 
                    shadow of their mighty sleeves.And those absolute wonders
                    of the world,Letting ud unfurl,Our flags of freedom,
                    As we find ourselves walking,In the shadow of their
                    selves.

                <p>
                    The stretch of sand together with the immensity of silence,
                    helps us to shake off the superficiality that is in each
                    of us. The great solitude leads us to long reflections.
